            <h1>ABOUT US:</h1>
            <p>As students of freeCodeCamp finish all certificates of the curriculum, they get the
               opportunity, and are encouraged, to work with nonprofit organizations. Examples
               have been Indonesia-based nonprofit Kopernik and People Saving Animals. In 2016,
               freeCodeCamp announced their "Open Source for Good" initiative, which extends and open
               sources their nonprofit work to all nonprofits and organizations to use. Within
               ten months of launching, the initiative has created seven open-source tools.
               Mail for Good is one of the projects, which helps organizations send bulk email
               messages at a low cost, which serves as a cheaper alternative to services such as
               MailChimp.</p>

            <h2>Curriculum</h2>  

            <p>The self-paced curriculum involves 1,400 hours of interactive coding challenges and web
               development projects, plus 800 hours of contributing to open-source projects for 
               and is constantly expanded by more challenges and projects. This translates into about
               one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into Responsive Web Design, JavaScript
               Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Libraries, data visualization, APIs and
               Microservices, and Information Security and Quality Assurance. Participants receive a
               certificate after completing each section.The curriculum emphasizes pair programming,
               intended to foster a culture of collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome
               a student's doubts about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as “impostor
               syndrome”). The languages and technologies currently taught by freeCodeCamp include HTML5,
               CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB,
               and Git.</p>
